Multitask Learning Approach for Network Traffic Classification

1. Copy the entire QUIC dataset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pvev0hJ82usPh6dWDlz7Lv8L6h3JpWhE) into the a folder, named Data.
2. Run the dataProcessQuic.py to perform pre-processing.
3. Now, you can run singletask.py, transferlearning.py or multitaskMasked.py. The parameters are defined at the begining of each file and they are self-explanatory.
